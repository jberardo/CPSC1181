  If you become familiar enough with object-oriented design, you
should be able to describe almost any common noun as an object.

  Consider a coin. It should never have a negative or zero value.

  Using javadoc form, document the preconditions for a Coin
constructor to ensure these requirements. Now extend your
object oriented thinking: what would be the logical object
used to create coins?

  Hint: think about the factory design pattern
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Factory_method_pattern

  /**
    
  */
  public Coin(double aValue)
  {
    
  }
