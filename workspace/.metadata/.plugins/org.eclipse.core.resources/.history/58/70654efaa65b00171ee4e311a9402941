/**
 * A client for the TicTacToe game, modified and extended from the
 * class presented in Deitel and Deitel "Java How to Program" book.
 * I made a bunch of enhancements and rewrote large sections of the
 * code.  In particular I created the TTTP (Tic Tac Toe Protocol)
 * which is entirely text based.  Here are the strings that are sent:
 *
 *  Client -> Server           Server -> Client
 *  ----------------           ----------------
 *  MOVE <n>  (0 <= n <= 8)    WELCOME <char>  (char in {X, O})
 *  QUIT                       VALID_MOVE
 *                             OTHER_PLAYER_MOVED <n>
 *                             VICTORY
 *                             DEFEAT
 *                             TIE
 *                             MESSAGE <text>
