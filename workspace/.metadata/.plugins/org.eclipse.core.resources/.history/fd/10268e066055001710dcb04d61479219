describe almost any common noun as an object

a coin should never have a negative or zero value
Using javadoc form, document the preconditions for
a Coin constructor to ensure these requirements.

Now extend your object oriented thinking: what would
be the logical object used to create coins?

  /**
    Constructs a coin object
    (Precondition: aValue >= 0)
    
    @param aValue coin value
  */
  public Coin(double aValue)
  {
      if (aValue <= 0)
      {
          throw new Exception("Value cannot be negative.");
      }
    ...
  }
  
  Logical objects used to create coins:
    Purse, VendingMachine, CashRegister and so on.
