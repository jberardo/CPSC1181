agreement between the user and the function

if the preconditions are met by the user, then the
postconditions will be satisfied by the method.

Example: preconditions of opening a file in Java.
The preconditions are that the exists() and canRead()
methods both return true. If they do not, then the file will not be opened.

preconditions of the nextLine method of the Scanner class?
What happens when you violate one of those preconditions?

If you violate one precondition, the contract between the class and the user is broken.
