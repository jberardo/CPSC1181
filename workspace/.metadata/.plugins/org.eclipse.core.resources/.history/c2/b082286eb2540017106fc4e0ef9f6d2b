The side effect is in the method:
  public void add(Coin aCoin)

It sends a message to the println method in System.out object. It should only add the coin's value to its total.
It is generally a bad idea to separate the input/output from this class.
The output should be printed outside the class, using an accessor method to retrieve the total value.
