  The overuse of static methods is the mark of
poor object oriented design. Explain how you can
compute the values of the circle and the sphere
in a more object oriented fashion.

We could use two classes, one for Circle and one for Sphere.
In those classes, we have accessor methods to retrieve the values computed by each class.

  Then provide the object oriented solution
  Hint: you will need to create two objects.
