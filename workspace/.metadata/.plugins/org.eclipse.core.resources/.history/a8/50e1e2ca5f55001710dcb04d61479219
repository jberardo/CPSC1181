describe almost any common noun as an object

a coin should never have a negative or zero value
Using javadoc form, document the preconditions for
a Coin constructor to ensure these requirements.

Now extend your object oriented thinking: what would
be the logical object used to create coins?

  /**
    Constructs a coin object
    pre
  */
  public Coin(double aValue)
  {
    
  }
  
  Purse, VendingMachine, CashRegister and so on.
