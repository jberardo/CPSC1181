/**
 * A server program which accepts requests from clients to
 * capitalize strings.  When clients connect, a new thread is
 * started to handle an interactive dialog in which the client
 * sends in a string and the server thread sends back the
 * capitalized version of the string.
 *
 * The program is runs in an infinite loop, so shutdown in platform
 * dependent.  If you ran it from a console window with the "java"
 * interpreter, Ctrl+C generally will shut it down.
