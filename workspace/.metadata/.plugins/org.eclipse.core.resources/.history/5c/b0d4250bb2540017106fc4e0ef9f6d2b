This class is big and have a lot of methods, it appears to be cohesive.
As the description says:
" This class is the abstract superclass of all actual implementations of the Abstract Window Toolkit"
and
"Most applications should not call any of the methods in this class directly"
I can assume that this class, as the name says, is a ToolKit for GUI applications.
Its methods are implementing operations and waiting for events related to the Window and Desktop graphical parts of the application.
