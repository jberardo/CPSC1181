A static method has no implicit parameters. Sometimes,
we use static methods because all the method parameters
are primitive types (such as int, char, etc.). Primitive
types are not objects, so they cannot be implicit
parameters of a method.

  Write four static methods that compute the
    circumference of a circle with a given radius r
    area of a circle with a given radius r
    surface area of a sphere with radius r
    volume of a sphere with radius r

  Place the four static methods into a class Geometry
  
  public class Geometry
  {
    public Geometry()
    {
    
    }
    
    public final double getCircumference(double r)
    {
    }

    public final double getArea(double r)
    {
    }
    
    public final double getSurfaceArea(double r)
    {
    }    
    
    public final double getVolume(double r)
    {
    }
  }
