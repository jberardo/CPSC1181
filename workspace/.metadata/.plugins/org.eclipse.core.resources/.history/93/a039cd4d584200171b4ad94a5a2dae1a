3.1) What is the present value of an annuity that will pay out $10,000 in each of the next 20 years if the interest rate is 8 percent?
$ 98181.47

5)
a) x is positive
b) x is zero or negative
c) x is at least 10
d) x is less than 10
e) x and y are both zero
f) x is even

a) x > 0
b) x <= 0
c) x >= 10
d) x < 10
e) (x == 0) && (y == 0)
f) (x % 2) == 0

8) What is the output the program produces? Change the value of limit and comment i++. What happened in both cases?
Output:
	i = 0
	i = 1
	i = 2
	i = 3
	i = 4
	i = 5

When the value of limit is changed, the program loops until the new value minus one.
If the instruction i++ is commented out, the loop will be an infinite loop and the program will run forever or crash at some point.
