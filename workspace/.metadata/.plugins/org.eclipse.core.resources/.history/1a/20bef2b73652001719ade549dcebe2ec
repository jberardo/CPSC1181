  When designing an object, you must consider the inherent dependencies.
  
  Study the Java APIâ€™s documentation in order to determine the dependencies
between the following classes:

    String
    StringTokenizer
    PrintStream
    Random

According to Java API documentation, the classes have the following dependencies:

String
  StringBuffer 
  StringBuilder
  CharSequence
  Charset
  Locale
 
StringTokenizer
  String
  
PrintStream  
  String
  File
  OutputStream
  CharSequence
  Locale
  
Random
  DoubleStream
  IntStream
  LongStream

As we can see, StringTokenizer and PrintStream depends on the String class.
The Random class doesn't have any relationship with any of the other 3 classes.
