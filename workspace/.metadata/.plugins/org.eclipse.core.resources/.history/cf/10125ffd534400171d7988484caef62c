/**
 * Program that determines if two circles are disjoint, mutually contained or overlapping.
 * Both circles have a fixed center point at the same horizontal line.
 * Each circle has an user-defined radius.
 *  
 * In order to determine that, we need to calculate the distance between their centers.
 * The formula for calculating the distance between their center is:
 *   sqrt((xcenter1 - xcenter2) ^ 2 + (ycenter1 - ycenter1) ^ 2)
 *   
 * This program could only use the y-coordinate to calculate their distance, since that
 * their coordinates are fixed. But calculating their distances makes this program work 
 * even if we use user-defined coordinates.
