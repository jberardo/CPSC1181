  Suppose a CashRegister class has the following methods:

    recordPurchase
    enterPayment
    giveChange
    getPurchaseAmount

  Provide an appropriate precondition and postcondition
for the recordPurchase method of the CashRegister class,
which is defined as follows:

/**
Records the purchase price of an item.
@param amount the price of the purchased item
*/
public void recordPurchase(double amount)
{
  purchase = purchase + amount;
}
pre: amount >= 0
post: getPurchaseAmount >= 0
