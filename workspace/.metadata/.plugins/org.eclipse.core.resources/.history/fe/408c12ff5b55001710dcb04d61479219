    A company allows its "employees" to "check out" certain "items", such as handheld computers
and music players, to gain personal experience with them.

  Popular items can be "reserved" on a "first come/first" served basis. 
A reservation "list" is kept for each item. There is a "fine" for overdue items.

  Your development teamâ€™s task is to write a software program that allows the "stockroom
clerk" to "check out" "items" and "check them back in", "reserve items", "notify employees" when a
reserved item has been "returned", produce "reports of overdue items", and "track payment of
fines"
