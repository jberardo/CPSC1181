{
	 // A Ball is colored a random color
	// A Ball should be able to move relative to the component it is in
		// and draw itself in the component
	// bounce a ball ->  choose the distance the ball will move in the x and y directions
	// represented as dx and dy
	// ball moves -> dx and dy are added to the ball's x and y positions
	// dx and dy should both be greater than 0
	// choose the dx and dy to be equal to have the ball move at
		// a constant slope of either plus or minus 1
	// ball reaches the edge it is in
		// must reverse its direction by changing the sign of dx and/or dy
	// program should have an "Add Ball" button
	// button pressed => a new thread is created that moves and displays a new ball
