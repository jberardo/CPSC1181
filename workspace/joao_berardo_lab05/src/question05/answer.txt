  When you use classes from the Java library, you may
not have not really considered the amount of code that
is executed behind the scenes.

  This is because for the most part, that code executes
silently. The following class has one method with a
side effect.

  Describe the side effect, and explain why it is not
desirable and what you could do to remedy it.

/**
A purse computes the total value of a collection of coins.
*/
public class Purse
{
  private double total;

  /**
  Constructs an empty purse.
  */
  public Purse()
  {
    total = 0;
  }

  /**
  Adds a coin to the purse.
  @param aCoin the coin to add
  */
  public void add(Coin aCoin)
  {
    total = total + aCoin.getValue();
    System.out.println("The total is now " + total);
  }
  
  /* compares the value of the coins in the purse to another purse*/
  public boolean hasMoreValueThan(Purse otherPurse)
  {
    if(total > otherPurse.getTotal())
    {
      return true;
    }
    else
    {
      return false;
    }
  }

  /**
  Gets the total value of the coins in the purse.
  @return the sum of all coin values
  */
  public double getTotal()
  {
    return total;
  }
}
