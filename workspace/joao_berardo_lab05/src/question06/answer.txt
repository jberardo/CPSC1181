  Every time you invoke a method, be it from the API
or from your own code, you must consider the
preconditions and the postconditions.

  In very simple terms, pre and post conditions can be
thought of as an agreement between the user and the
function. Essentially, if the preconditions are met by
the user, then the postconditions will be satisfied by
the method.

  As an example consider the preconditions of opening a
file in Java. The preconditions are that the exists()
and canRead() methods both return true. If they do not,
then the file will not be opened.

  What are the preconditions of the nextLine method of
the Scanner class? What happens when you violate one
of those preconditions?
