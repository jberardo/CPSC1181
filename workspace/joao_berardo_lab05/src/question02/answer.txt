  “A class should represent a single concept. All interface features
should be closely related to the single concept that the class represents.
Such a public interface is said to be cohesive”(Horstmann 381). 

  Using the Horstmann definition, consider the java.awt.Toolkit class in
the Java API.
  
  Is its public interface cohesive? Explain why or why not.
