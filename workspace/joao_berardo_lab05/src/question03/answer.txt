According to Java API documentation, the classes have the following dependencies:

String
  StringBuffer 
  StringBuilder
  CharSequence
  Charset
  Locale
 
StringTokenizer
  String
  
PrintStream  
  String
  File
  OutputStream
  CharSequence
  Locale

The Random class doesn't have any relationship with any of the other 3 classes.
