1.1) To implement the Comparable interface, we need to implement the following method:
  - int compareTo(Object otherObject);

1.4) The outcome is the bank account list sorted descending.
The implementation depends on what the user wants to see.
I think the best approach is to give the user an option to sort ascending or descending.
We can implement that in the compareTo method switching the return values depending on the user's option.
