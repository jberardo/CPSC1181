E 7.16
Add a method to the Table class below that computes the average
of the neighbors of a table element in the eight directions shown
in Figure 15:
public double neighborAverage(int row, int column)

However, if the element is located at the boundary of the array,
include only the neighbors that are in the table.

For example, if row and column are both 0, there are only three neighbors.

public class Table
{
	private int[][] values;
	public Table(int rows, int columns) { values = new int[rows][columns]; }
	public void set(int i, int j, int n) { values[i][j] = n; }
}

E 7.17
Given the Table class of Exercise E7.16 , add a method that returns the sum
of the i'th row (if horizontal is true) or column (if horizontal is false ):
public double sum(int i, boolean horizontal)

Repeat Exercise E7.17, but make the bars vertical, with the tallest bar twenty
asterisks high.
