A run is a sequence of adjacent repeated values.
Write a program that generates a sequence of 20 random
die tosses in an array and that prints the die values,
marking the runs by including them in parentheses,
like this:
1 2 (5 5) 3 1 2 4 3 (2 2 2 2) 3 6 (5 5) 6 3 1

Use the following pseudocode:

Set a boolean variable inRun to false.
For each valid index i in the array
	 If inRun
		 If values[i] is different from the preceding value
			Print ).
			inRun = false.
	 If not inRun
		 If values[i] is the same as the following value
			Print (.
			inRun = true.
		Print values[i].
	If inRun, print ).
