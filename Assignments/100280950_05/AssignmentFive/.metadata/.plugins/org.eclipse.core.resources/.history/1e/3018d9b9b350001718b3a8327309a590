Magic squares.

An n × n matrix that is filled with the numbers
1, 2, 3, . . ., n^2 is a magic square if the sum
of the elements in each row, in each column, and
in the two diagonals is the same value.

Write a program that reads in 16 values from the keyboard and tests
whether they form a magic square when put into a 4×4 array.

You need to test two features:
	1.	Does each of the numbers 1, 2, ..., 16 occur in the user input?
	2.	When the numbers are put into a square, are the sums of the rows, columns, and diagonals equal to each other?
