Mean and standard deviation

Write a program that reads a set of floating-point data values.
Choose an appropriate mechanism for prompting for the end of the data set.
When all values have been read, print out the count of the values, the aver­age, and the standard deviation.
The average of a data set {x 1 , . . ., x n } is x = ∑ x i n , where ∑ x i = x 1 + ... + x n is the sum of the input values.
The standard deviation is:
(sum(x^2) - (1/n * sum(x)^2)) / n - 1

You can compute this quantity by keeping track of the count, the sum, and the sum of squares as you process the input values.

Your program should use a class DataSet. That class should have a method:
public void add(double value)

and the methods:
getAverage and getStandardDeviation
